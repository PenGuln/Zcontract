# zcontract

#### Introduction
This is a simple implemention of HAWK, you can read the paper here https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/675.pdf. We realize the ZKP part using Zokrates, which is a amazing library helping connect zero-knowlegde-proof to Ethereum network. 

#### How to use
1. Install Brownie
2. Install Zokrates

#### Evaluation

The circuit of freeze contains 986435 constraints, compute contains 50564 constraints, finalize contains 196480 constraints.
